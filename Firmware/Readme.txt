
This is a re-write of the firmware that normally comes with the STM32F103-ADF4351-OLED board.

To edit and compile the firmware I use the free "Atollic TrueSTUDIO Pro for STM32 v9.3.0" package from the Atollic web site.

To edit and compile the PC client software I use the free "Embarcadero C++ Builder" package from the Embarcadero website.

Have yet to decide what serial communication protocol to use from/to a PC client based config software.

Note ..
 GitHub doesn't allow the usual TrueStudio ".cproject" and ".project" files, so I've put them into the .rar file so that you can
 extract them to the firmware root folder before importing the project into TrueStudio.
