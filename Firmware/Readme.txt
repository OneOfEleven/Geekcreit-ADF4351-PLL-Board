
This is a re-write of the firmware that normally comes with the STM32F103-ADF4351-OLED board.

To edit and compile the firmware I use the free "Atollic TrueSTUDIO Pro for STM32 v9.3.0" package from the Atollic web site.

To edit and compile the PC client software I use the free "Embarcadero C++ Builder" package from the Embarcadero website.

Have yet to decide what serial communication protocol to use from/to a PC client based config software.
